# General Assembly - Project 1

#### Project Name: Arcade Tower Stacker

## Project Overview

This was my first project assignment for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive programme after 2 weeks of learning vanilla Javascript. We had four days to produce a working, interactive game which includes the use of Javascript for DOM manipulation that is triggered by a browser event.

### Description

This is a recreation of the stacker game found in arcades. The objective of the game is simple, to align every row on top of each other. Player wins if player manage to stack all 20 rows. The width of the row gets shorter every time if you do not stack the full width on top thus increasing the difficulty.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was figuring out why the sliding animation was cut short the higher the stack goes.

### Known Issues

The win condition is not working as intended at the moment.
